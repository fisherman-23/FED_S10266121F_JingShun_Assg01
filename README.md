Redesigned IKEA website for FED Assignment 1

**Overview:**

My idea for this FED Assignment 1 is for a redesign of IKEA’s website. This new responsive website will be user-friendly and visually appealing, while helping to showcase IKEA’s products and services, and allow users to view and interact with product details seamlessly.

**Target audience:**

Homeowners, renters and individuals who are looking to purchase IKEA furniture through online means. This website is meant to help these users by providing information on products and promotions, showing rooms to help users draw inspiration, platform to apply for membership and finally to place their order and get their items delivered.

**Features overview (Value provided):**

Consistent Aesthetic: A modern, Scandinavian-inspired theme with light colours, ample whitespace, and simple icons to enhance the browsing experience.

Responsive and Accessible Design: Optimised layouts for desktop and mobile, with accessibility features for easy use by all users.

Information-packed Product Page: Information about discounts, product description, statistics bar, reviews and summary of top features to ensure users make the right choice.

Interactive Showroom Galleries: Allows users to browse through pre-designed rooms for inspiration.

Sustainable Choices Highlighted: Clearly marked eco-friendly products with unique badges and descriptions to attract conscious shoppers.

Micro-interactions: Microinteractions implemented that interact with hover, scroll and tap interactions. These subtle cues help to enhance the browsing experience.

**What is this website catering for**
